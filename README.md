This project aims to offer a scalable and efficient solution for educational institutions or individual educators to manage student data effectively.

## Features

*   **Student Management:** Add, update, delete, and retrieve student records.
*   **RESTful API:**  Uses FastAPI to provide a clean and well-documented API.
*   **Data Validation:** Built-in data validation to ensure data integrity.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverages FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities for improved performance.
*   **Database Integration (Optional):** Can be integrated with various databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).  (Needs Implementation)
